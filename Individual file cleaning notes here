# Clean Indivudal participant data and prepare for merge with group

 ~/Documents/Documents/01 - UofT/Foundation/Experiments/Exp_2/Cleaned_Files/P16208_4_052924/Exp2_csvCombo_P16208.R 
Data preparation -> takes the output from presentation and creates one csv per participant #github
* 1 - 1000 -> assemble 14 csv from presentation and first line of cleaning per participants
  * note output files (.log & .txt) needs to be converted to csvs and renamed to Pz_BX.csv and Txt_BX.csv
* 1001 - 1029 Halt for duplicates  -> stops program to check duplicates
  * 1001 -> “break”
  * CMD+ F “halt”
  * check out the dupes files in the environment window
    * if dupes are indicated (observations > 0) then uncomment the corresponding “dupes_all” segment and run it
    * look at the dupes_all datafile -> open corresponding “detect_X”  from the enviro window - note trial or row numbers & navigate to there
    * keep vs. Remove dupes rules 
      * -> if correcting first response keep first response
      * -> if jumped response (before the target) if jump is =< 600ms remove and keep response post target
      * there should only be one response per trial
    * transfer row numbers to the the section below to remove them
    * run that block and cross check each detect_X to make sure the right rows are removed
  * Once the dupes are sorted out then run the rest of the code
* 1030 - 1275 - Continue Cleaning - repeat steps for each block -> note Test has own section
  * Pivot_wider 
  * split condition column
  * recode & select
  * add exposure numbers 1 -24 and 26 (25th exposure is the test prime)
* 1276 - 1490 Final recoding and Accuracy checks (test has one stage to go still)
  * Wav & RMSQ
  * recode columns
  * harmonize presentation rt times
  * safety cross check
  * calculate outliers per person using the median 
  * assemble data frame
  * -> save the cleaned csv for later analysis
Should really end here but doesn’t - ditch the yucky stuff (new RMD would be an idea?)
Needs to confirm above 70% acc for each

Plots 1490 - 1650
* remove errors, remove > 200. , remove outliers to 2 SD
* Box Plot ALL
* Scatter Plots ALL
* rt summary table ALL
  * Exp Only
  * Scatter Block x Condition
  * Boxplot Block x Condition
  * rt tables

Test Accuracy
* test rt tables
* test Old New tables
* test location tables
* world’s ugliest violin plot
* prelim frequency distribution table
